# Stock Data Scraping and Storage

This Python script allows you to scrape stock data from CNN Money and Yahoo Finance, process it, and store it in both a CSV file and a SQLite database. It uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping and pandas for data processing and storage.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- BeautifulSoup (`bs4`)
- Requests (`requests`)
- Pandas (`pandas`)
- SQLAlchemy (`sqlalchemy`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas sqlalchemy numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Python script (`stock_data_scraper.py`) in a code editor or IDE.

3. Run the script. It will perform the following steps:
   - Scrape stock symbols from CNN Money.
   - For each symbol, fetch detailed stock data from Yahoo Finance.
   - Process the data and store it in a CSV file (`project1_2.csv`).
   - Create a SQLite database (`dbase1.db`) and store the data as a table.

4. You can access the scraped data from the CSV file or the SQLite database as needed.

## Configuration

You can customize the script by modifying the following variables:

- `url` (CNN Money URL): You can change this URL to scrape data from a different source if needed.

- `name`, `open_value`, `volume`, and `pe_ratio`: You can modify these variables to match the HTML structure of the website you're scraping if it changes.

## Data Sources

- [CNN Money](https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/): Source for hot stock symbols.

- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/): Source for detailed stock data.
